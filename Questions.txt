Questions:

1. How many features are there as input for one picture in the SS dataset? Is each pixel defined by an RGB value, such that one pixel is 3 inputs?

2. What does it mean for the algorithm to be 'out of core'? This is mentioned in several places.

3. In the second notebook, we use the test data in order to evaluate which degree of polynomial is best. I thought this was considered 'cheating' because you may pick a model that overfits that specific test data but does not generalize. This (I think) was the point of cross-validation, where we use training data to test and pseudogeneralize.

4. How many more features are adding when the degree of the polynomial increases? It seems that it would be very, very fast because you need a term (feature) for every combination of features whose total degree is less than the overall 'degree'.
